# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version will be benefit from security fixes. Maintainers of projects using this module are invited to update their dependency.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported through Github issues, here: https://github.com/bytemare/crypto/issues.
If the issue is sensitive enough that the reporter thinks the discussion needs more confidentiality, we can discuss options there (e.g. On a Security Advisory or per e-mail).
